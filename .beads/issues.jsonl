This is new behavior.\n2.

Install\n6. **Restart Home Assistant**\n\n### Option B: Manual install (if you hate HACS)\nThe project also documents a manual `custom_components` install path. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n(Use this only if you’re already comfortable managing `/config/custom_components`.)\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 — Configure the integration (connect HA ↔ B2)\n\nIn Home Assistant:\n1. **Settings → Devices \u0026 Services → Add Integration**\n2. Search: **S3 Compatible Backup** :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n3. Fill in:\n   - **Access Key ID**: (Backblaze Key ID)\n   - **Secret Access Key**: (Backblaze Application Key)\n   - **Bucket Name**: your bucket\n   - **Endpoint URL**: `https://s3.\u003cregion\u003e.backblazeb2.com` :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n   - **Region**: the region string (the `\u003cregion\u003e` part)\n   - **Prefix** (optional): default is fine (`homeassistant`) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}\n\nResult: your backups land in a predictable folder structure in the bucket (prefix/backups + metadata). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 — Make sure HA backups are configured the way you want\n\nHome Assistant’s backup system supports automatic backups from the UI, and the backup action `backup.create_automatic` uses those settings. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}\n\nIn HA:\n- **Settings → System → Backups → Backup settings**\n  - Set schedule (daily/weekly)\n  - Set retention (e.g., keep last 30)\n  - **Set a backup password/encryption** if you want “cloud bucket = safe even if leaked”\n\n\u003e Tip: For offsite, “encrypted backups” is worth it.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5 — Validate it end-to-end (don’t skip)\n1. Trigger a manual backup (from the Backups UI)\n2. Wait for upload\n3. Confirm you see new objects in B2\n4. Download one backup locally and keep it as your “known good” snapshot\n\n---\n\n## Step 6 — Monitoring / failure alerts (recommended)\nHA exposes an event entity for automatic backup status and provides an example automation to notify on failures. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}\n\nIf you want, we can wire an iOS push notification when automatic backup fails using:\n- `event.backup_automatic_backup` and its `failed_reason` attribute :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}\n\n---\n\n## Cost expectations (B2 is basically free at HA scale)\nBackblaze B2 pricing is typically:\n- ~$0.005/GB-month storage\n- First 10GB storage free (common on B2 pricing pages / posts) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nAt “HA backup” sizes, you’re usually talking **cents/month**, not dollars.\n\n---\n\n## Quick checklist\n- [ ] B2 bucket created (private)\n- [ ] Scoped application key created + stored safely\n- [ ] S3 Compatible Backup integration installed (HACS or manual)\n- [ ] Integration configured with correct endpoint + region\n- [ ] HA automatic backups configured + retention set\n- [ ] One manual backup verified in B2\n- [ ] (Optional) Backup failure notification automation added\n\n---\n","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-29T13:21:33.508045-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T15:53:46.926184-05:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-29T15:53:46.926184-05:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}
