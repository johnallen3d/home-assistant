{"id":"home-assistant-iqh","title":"Cooking state","description":"There is a gap in coverage in my kitchen zone. When I'm standing at my oven I'm outside of the zone. This causes issues for me - I'm preparing a meal and the lights go out. This is the primary reason for the 30s delay on kitchen absence. 30s does not appear to be long enough but I don't think the solution is to keep extending the timeout. I'm now thinking I need a helper to store state. Something like:\n\n- toggle \"cooking\" scene (maybe this needs to be script or automation)\n- set a helper to track that I'm in this state\n- update \"leaving kitchen\" to respect this, leave lights alone\n- update \"leaving charlie meal\" to respect this, leave lights alone\n- add a method for me to indicate I'm \"done cooking\"\n- reset helper to off state\n\nReview existing scripts, automations etc and build out a complete plan.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-19T18:57:31.599303-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T19:08:55.883264-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T19:08:55.883264-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented cooking mode feature with input_boolean helper, toggle script, and updated kitchen presence automation to respect cooking mode"}
