# Adaptive Lighting - General Purpose
# =============================================================================
# Uses template sensors for brightness/color temp based on sun position,
# time of day, and weather conditions.
#
# Usage examples:
#   # Simple - all lights adaptive
#   - action: script.adaptive_lights
#     data:
#       lights:
#         - light.kitchen
#         - light.island_bulb
#
#   # Night mode - turn off at night
#   - action: script.adaptive_lights
#     data:
#       lights: [light.bedroom_lamp, light.bedroom_overhead_left]
#       night_mode: "off"
#
#   # Night mode - dim RGB (bathroom style)
#   - action: script.adaptive_lights
#     data:
#       lights: [light.bathroom_lamp, light.bathroom_strip]
#       night_mode: dim_rgb
#       night_lights: [light.bathroom_strip]
#       night_rgb: [255, 159, 242]
#
#   # Night mode - dim warm white
#   - action: script.adaptive_lights
#     data:
#       lights: [light.kitchen]
#       night_mode: dim_warm

# TV Time - Adaptive ambient lighting for watching TV
# =============================================================================
# Context: TV on left wall, Dad's chair on right facing TV, sliding glass
# doors to right of chair. Living room light causes glare, kitchen lights don't.
#
# Behavior by sun/time:
#   - Daytime (sun elevation > 5°): No changes (natural light sufficient)
#   - Evening (sun elevation <= 5°, before 11pm): Dim warm ambient in kitchen
#   - Late night (11pm-6am): Even dimmer, just kitchen strip
#
# Always:
#   - Living room light OFF (causes glare)
#   - Bedroom lights OFF
#   - Kitchen counter switch OFF
