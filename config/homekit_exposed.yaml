# Entities exposed to HomeKit Bridge
#
# This uses a domain-based model with include/exclude lists.
# Unlike voice assistant (per-entity), HomeKit exposes entire domains
# and then refines with include_entities and exclude_entities.
#
# Usage:
#   just config::deploy-homekit   - Apply settings and restart HA
#   just config::check-homekit    - Dry run, show what would change

# Domains to include (all entities in these domains are exposed)
include_domains:
  - light
  - lock

# Specific entities to include (from domains NOT in include_domains)
include_entities:
  # Scenes (used on dashboards)
  - scene.lights_out
  - scene.cooking
  # Scripts (adaptive lighting - used on dashboards)
  - script.adaptive_charlie_eating
  - script.adaptive_good_morning
  - script.adaptive_tv_time
  - script.adaptive_winding_down
  - script.adaptive_eating
  # Switches (only useful ones, not camera/vacuum controls)
  - switch.kitchen_counter_switch
  - switch.laundry_room_switch

# Entities to exclude (from included domains)
exclude_entities:
  # ESPHome diagnostic LEDs
  - light.atom_echo_led
  # Plug indicator lights (not actual lights)
  - light.bedroom_plug_dnd
