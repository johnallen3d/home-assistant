# Entities exposed to HomeKit Bridge
#
# This uses a domain-based model with include/exclude lists.
# Unlike voice assistant (per-entity), HomeKit exposes entire domains
# and then refines with include_entities and exclude_entities.
#
# Usage:
#   just config::deploy-homekit   - Apply settings and restart HA
#   just config::check-homekit    - Dry run, show what would change

# Domains to include (all entities in these domains are exposed)
# Note: lock domain removed - Nuki lock is exposed directly via Matter fabric sharing
include_domains:
  - light

# Specific entities to include (from domains NOT in include_domains)
include_entities:
  # Scenes (used on dashboards)
  - scene.lights_out
  - scene.shaving
  - scene.working
  # Scripts (adaptive lighting - used on dashboards)
  - script.arriving_home
  - script.charlie_eating
  - script.eating
  - script.good_morning
  - script.kitchen_chill
  - script.tv_time
  - script.winding_down
  # Note: toggle_cooking removed - use input_boolean.cooking_mode instead (shows state)
  # Switches (only useful ones, not camera/vacuum controls)
  - switch.kitchen_counter_switch
  - switch.laundry_room_switch
  - switch.sound_machine_outlet
  # Helpers (booleans show as switches with ON/OFF state)
  - input_boolean.charlie_presence
  - input_boolean.cooking_mode
  - input_boolean.hobby_mode
  - input_boolean.meditation_mode
  - input_boolean.working_mode
  - script.toggle_meditation
  # Charlie presence scripts
  - script.charlies_home
  - script.charlies_away

# Entities to exclude (from included domains)
exclude_entities:
  # ESPHome diagnostic LEDs
  - light.atom_echo_led
  # Plug indicator lights (not actual lights)
  - light.bedroom_plug_dnd
  # Individual bulbs (use light.living_room_overhead_light group instead)
  - light.living_room_overhead_thread
  - light.living_room_overhead_wifi
