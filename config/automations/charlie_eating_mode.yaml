# Charlie Eating Mode State Handler
# Reacts to charlie_eating_mode boolean changes to control island lighting.
#
# The boolean (input_boolean.charlie_eating_mode) is the user-facing switch:
# - Visible on Charlie's shapes dashboard as a toggle
# - Manual override for island light during meals
#
# This automation handles the lighting logic:
# - ON: Set island to 80% brightness, warm white (2700K)
# - OFF: Check presence and turn off lights appropriately
#   - If charlie_meal zone active: keep island on at adaptive
#   - If no presence: wait presence_delay, then turn off
# - AUTO-OFF: If charlie_eating_mode is on but no presence for 60s, turn off charlie_eating_mode
