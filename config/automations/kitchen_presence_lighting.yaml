# Kitchen Presence Lighting
# Turns kitchen lights on/off based on FP2 presence sensor kitchen zone
#
# On entry: Uses adaptive lighting script for time-appropriate brightness/color
# On exit: Turns lights off after 30s delay (unless presence returns to either zone)
#
# Note: Charlie Meal zone is inside Kitchen zone. Island light is shared:
# - Kitchen turns it ON (via kitchen_lights group)
# - Kitchen turns it OFF only if charlie_meal is also clear
# - Charlie Meal automation handles island when charlie_meal zone is active
