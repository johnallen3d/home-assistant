# Kitchen Presence Lighting
# Turns kitchen lights on/off based on FP2 presence sensor kitchen zone
#
# On entry: Uses adaptive lighting script for time-appropriate brightness/color
# On exit: Turns lights off after 30s delay (unless presence returns to either zone)
#
# Note: Charlie Meal zone is inside Kitchen zone. The island light is managed
# separately by the Charlie Meal automation - this one only controls sink/lightstrip.
