# Bathing Mode State Handler
# Reacts to bathing_mode boolean changes to control bathroom lighting.
#
# The boolean (input_boolean.bathing_mode) is the user-facing switch:
# - Exposed to HomeKit as a switch (shows ON/OFF state)
# - Visible on dashboards as a toggle
#
# This automation handles the lighting logic:
# - ON: Activate bathing scene (low brightness, warm color)
# - OFF: Check presence and turn off lights appropriately
#
# Note: When bathing_mode is ON, bathroom_presence automation
# won't turn off lights (bypasses presence sensor).
