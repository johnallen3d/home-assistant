# Charlie Meal Presence Lighting
# Turns island light on when Charlie enters the meal zone
#
# On entry: Uses adaptive lighting script for time-appropriate brightness/color
# On exit: No action - kitchen automation handles turn-off since charlie_meal
#          zone is inside kitchen zone (can't leave charlie_meal without
#          either being in kitchen or leaving kitchen entirely)
#
# Note: Skips if cooking_mode is on (cooking takes priority)
